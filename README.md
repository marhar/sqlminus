Note
====

Note: I'm in the process of moving this package from google code
to github, and taking the opportunity to:

-  move around the test cases and build scripts.
-  update the docs to markdown.
-  detail the magic incantations for getting this to run on Mac.

I'm checking this in as a work in progress for these three
things... let me know if I've messed something up!
